This week I started a new job working an awesome company called New Relic.
I'm really excited by this new role and working for a fast-growing company
with an awesome culture.

I've joined the Solution Consultant team where I will be working with clients
across EMEA to discover, learn and be successful with the New Relic platform. In
a few weeks I'll be travelling to San Francisco and Portland for training where
I'll learn loads about the company, meet my US colleagues and get hands on.

If you work for a company that has a digital presence, you should definitely
check out what [New Relic](https://newrelic.com) has to offer, you can be up and
running in a few minutes and the built-in dashboards are awesome to see your
entire operation in a single pane of glass.
