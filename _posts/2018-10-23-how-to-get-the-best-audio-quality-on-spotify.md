I'm a music obsessive and perhaps what some people might call an Audiophile
(albeit on a low budget!). I also love Spotify because it lets me tap into a
vast library of music, whenever and wherever I am. Some may say that Spotify is
the enemy of good sounding music due to their compression algorithms and low
bitrates but I weigh that up against how much new music I get to listen to and
it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. At home, I try to listen to most of my
music on vinyl.

So if you are a Spotify user and want to get the best possible audio quality,
there are a few things you can do.

1. Open the Spotify app and go to *Library*
2. Press the cog icon on the top right to open *Settings*
3. Open the *Playback* menu
4. Under *Volume Level* choose *Quiet (preserves dynamics)*. This option means
the Spotify app doesn't apply [compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression)
to the tracks which means there will be a greater difference in volume between
tracks of differing volume. Essentially, you're listening to the music with
dynamic range left as it was intended to be listened to.
5. Go back to the main *Settings* page and choose *Music Quality*
6. Under both *Streaming* and *Download* sections, set the value to *Very High*

NOTE: streaming at 320kbps will use more mobile data so watch out if your mobile
carrier charges you for data or if you're roaming abroad.

There are similar steps to take in the Desktop app for Spotify too. Happy
listening!
