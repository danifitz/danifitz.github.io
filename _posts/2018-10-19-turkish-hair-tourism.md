I got back from a week in Istanbul today. What a city! Around 20 million
inhabitants jostle for space in the bustling markets and narrow streets that
make up the place which straddles both Europe and Asia. Whilst I did the typical
things you might expect whilst in Turkey (drink tea, eat Baklava, shop for rugs)
I also noticed a strange thing. I must have counted over 100 men with bizarre
looking patches on their head. I soon realised the raw, bloody patch on their
heads where new fresh hair occupied was the result of hair transplant surgery.

I did a bit of digging online and it seems there are over 350 clinics for this
procedure in Istanbul alone! In the Sabiha airport on my way home I saw women
in various stages of nose job recovery too. There's an
(article on the BBC)[https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/758f9f1f-e8b6-4a97-8046-b0888e610edd]
about this if you're interested to hear more about this interesting trend.

Anyway I'll be taking a trip back there soon for botox, lip enhancements and
buttock implants, Kim K watch out!
